Dear Hans_Ake

I was unable to find your email address, so I try it this way. 
I hope you don't mind.

I am trying to update p1pr.exe source code so it will generate IBM system/3 compatible assembler code which will then run on my still operational system/3.

Please let me know which C compiler I need to use to re-compile sources of p1pr.exe 

Thanks !
